A repository built based on "The Rust Programming Language" for learning the Rust language.

Some of the code in this repository is not exactly copied from the book. Instead, it incorporates some of my own understanding. There may be some inconsistencies with the book, and I apologize for that. My intention was not to copy the entire book verbatim, but to learn the entire book through my own understanding. 
If there are any ambiguities or issues in certain places, please leave a message or raise an issue. Welcome all friends who like Rust and enjoy tinkering with technology! 
Let's open the magical world of Rust together.



```

Don't get too obsessed with why Rust defines its syntax structure in this way, and don't get too caught up in the details.
As you continue to learn, you will have a deeper understanding of the author's intentions and be able to better appreciate the benefits of this syntax structure.
Rust is a strict instructor. It will constrain your coding habits and make the code more efficient and secure.

```
This is my personal understanding, and it is also a piece of advice for all of you who are just starting to learn Rust.
